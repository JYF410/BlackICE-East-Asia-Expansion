 tfv_australia.1.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Proposal about the Singapore Strategy"
 tfv_australia.1.d:0 "The Singapore Strategy has been the cornerstone of our deterrence policy against [JAP.GetNameDef] since the end of the Great War. However, the redeployment of the Main Fleet to Singapore in case of attack is reliant on support from our allies in [From.GetNameDef]. With the potential threat against British holdings in the Far East increasing by the day, the [From.GetAdjective] high command has presented a potential new stratagem, that would see Australia in far greater control of the defense of the region.\n\nIt's a sound plan, and the only question is whether we believe they can provide the security we require."
 tfv_australia.1.a:1 "Australia should provide the first line of defense in Southeast Asia."
 tfv_australia.1.b:0 "The Singapore Strategy will remain as it always has."
 tfv_australia.2.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Transfers Colonial Holdings"
 tfv_australia.2.d:1 "The [From.GetAdjective] has passed the law that will transfer control of all [From.GetAdjective] colonial possessions near Singapore and Borneo to [Root.GetNameDef].\n\nOur national safety is finally in our own hands."
 tfv_australia.2.a:0 "We will not disappoint."
tfv_australia.10.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Offers Protection for Our Colonies"
 tfv_australia.10.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has initiated negotiations with [Root.GetAdjective] diplomats for the potential transfer of responsibility over the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia.\n\nConsidering the challenges inherent in defending said territory, a partnership may not be such a bad idea. It would mean that for the foreseeable future said territory would only be nominally [Root.GetAdjective], but nominal ownership is surely better than completely losing them."
 tfv_australia.10.a:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] will be the executor of [Root.GetAdjective] interests in the region."
 tfv_australia.10.b:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] territory will remain in [Root.GetAdjective] hands!"

 tfv_australia.11.d:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] troops stood ready to assume responsibilities for the protection of all [From.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia as soon as [From.GetLeader] approved the agreement.\n\nWhile some local resistance was met in the transfer, fear of foreign aggression ensures that most recognize the need for [Root.GetAdjective] defense."
 tfv_australia.11.a:0 "[Root.GetNameDefCap] will do what she must."
 tfv_australia.12.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Block Regional Safety Measures"
 tfv_australia.12.d:0 "Believing themselves to be sufficiently capable of protecting [From.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia, [From.GetNameDef] has refused our proposal of a shared defense strategy.\n\nUndoubtedly motivated by worries of colonial control, their actions are understandable. However, if they are incapable of protecting their territory - as we fear - we may see it used as the launch platform for an attack on the Australian continent."
 tfv_australia.12.a:0 "We can only hope they will be able to resist."
 
 tfv_australia.70.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Right to Control Protectorates"
 tfv_australia.70.d:0 "Claiming that a failure on the part of [Root.GetNameDef] to defend its colonial holdings in Southeast Asia would have catastrophic implications for [From.GetNameDef] national defense, [From.GetLeader] has requested that the [From.GetAdjective] government be given full, independent responsibility for the defense of the region.\nWhile not an outright demand, the growth of [From.GetAdjective] strategic and military influence in the region has the argument make some sense. The counterbalance being the recent political distancing from us that [From.GetNameDef] has embraced.\nThis would be an agreement with a potential partner, not a subject, and would leave the colonies de facto out of our hands, should [From.GetNameDef] choose to make it so."
 tfv_australia.70.a:0 "Yes, the stability of Southeast Asia is a priority."
 tfv_australia.70.b:0 "No, we will be the sole controller of our own colonial possessions!"
 tfv_australia.71.t:0 "Defensive Commission"
 tfv_australia.71.d:0 "Following overtures from the [Root.GetAdjective] military command, [From.GetNameDef] has decided to give us \"intermediate control\" of all [From.GetAdjective] colonial holdings in Southeast Asia.\n\nWith the old forces of the Pacific none the wiser, our attempts to ensure [Root.GetNameDef] dominance over the region continues."
 tfv_australia.71.a:0 "We'll make the old country proud."
 tfv_australia.72.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declines \"Defense Project\""
 tfv_australia.72.d:0 "Despite overtures from the [Root.GetAdjective] High Command, [From.GetNameDef] has rejected our request for control of their colonies in the Southeast Asian region.\n\nOur ambitions are untempered, however. We will continue to seek ways of securing [Root.GetAdjective] prominence in the Pacific."

Following several weeks of lunches, dinners, garden parties, receptions, and more dinners, he has finally succeeded in securing a private audience with the new King. \n\nAfter an exchange of pleasantries and small talk, the topic turns to politics. The King goes on a lengthy tirade about Commonwealth solidarity and loyalty to the mother country, and as he goes to address continental politics [AST.GetLeader] cannot help but feel a little uncomfortable.

 ast.1.t:0 "Expand Conscription to unmarried men?"
 ast.1.desc:0 "A bill has been proposed for the conscription of unmarried men into the CMF. Historically in 1939, conscription was introduced for unmarried men aged 21, unlucky to be that age in 1939, these men would train for three months in the CMF and would only serve in Australia or Australian territory such as Papua New Guinea. The issue of conscription wasn't a divided issue as it was in the Great War, so policies such as this one did not cause extensive controversy."
 ast.1.a:0 "Every man shall do his duty" tfv_australia.1.desc:0 "With our ally France surrendering, we must take more serious attitudes towards the war, let us stand united against the enemy! Historically Australia struggled to gain substantial amounts of volunteers in '39, however the Fall of France shocked the Australian government and populace and surges in enlistments occured, just 48,496 in June 1940."
 tfv_australia.3.t:0 "Aboriginals in the Army"
 tfv_australia.3.desc:0 "We must decide whether to allow aboriginal and other ethnic minorities to be allowed to volunteer into the army and be applicable for conscription if the nation has it. In 1939 aboriginals weren't actually excluded from the Australian Armed Forces, perhaps due to the low numbers initially, however in 1940 the Defence Committee of Australia decided to exclude aboriginal enlistment due to it being 'neither necessary not desirable'. Aboriginals were not seen in large numbers in the AIF until the Japanese entry into the war where aboriginal exclusion was lessened. Many European Australians were fervently against aboriginal inclusion into the Australian Armed Forces due to the possibility that they would guide Japanese troops through Papua New Guinea and Australia and other assistance for personal gain."

 tfv_south_africa.5.d:0 "The Empire Exhibition in Johannesburg concluded today after four months of festivities. Including five hundred exhibitors from eighteen different commonwealth nations and nearly two million visitors, the exhibition was the first to be held in the newly formed Union of South Africa. The event promoted the sale and import of imperial goods and services across the world. Recently constructed contemporary buildings and electric infrastructure showcased the outstanding features of modern South Africa. The finish line of the Schlesinger African Air race was also observed in conjunction with the exhibition. The race, which only included imperial pilots and machines, showcased the ever increasingly strong potential of aviation over long distances with a route of 6,150 miles.\n“There is an atmosphere of prosperity about Johannesburg at present. You can sense it as you walk the streets of the Golden City. The city is on the crest of a prosperity wave. You can discern it in the high horse-power cars that travel the roads. You can see it in the well-filled restaurants and places of amusement, but most of all it is revealed in the intense building activity which is proceeding in all parts of the city.” wrote John McLean in African Affairs"

 tfv_raj.8.d1: "A violent mob stormed an arms factory today, disrupting production and setting fire to key manufacturing areas before authorities could restore order. Machinery has been damaged, raw materials looted, and the workforce intimidated into fleeing. With production slowed, our ability to supply weapons for ongoing operations has been temporarily hindered."
 tfv_raj.8.d2: "Protesters overwhelmed security, smashing equipment and throwing completed rifles into the streets before torching a stockpile of gunpowder. The chaos forced workers to abandon their posts, leaving the factory in ruins. Officials fear that stolen weapons may now be in the hands of nationalist militias seeking to challenge British rule."
 tfv_raj.8.d3: "Striking workers, angered by poor conditions and political grievances, sabotaged key assembly lines, setting back production for weeks. Many carried banners demanding independence, calling for a free India. The loss of critical manufacturing time will strain our ability to replenish military supplies as unrest spreads."
 tfv_raj.8.d4: "A sudden riot outside an arms depot turned violent, leading to looting and the destruction of stored ammunition. The attack is believed to have been organized by members of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, aiming to cripple British military production and arm local revolutionaries."
 tfv_raj.8.d5: "Hindu and Muslim nationalist factions clashed in an industrial sector before turning their fury on a nearby weapons factory. Accusing each other of betrayal in the independence struggle, the fighting quickly escalated. By the time authorities restored order, the factory lay in ruins, with stolen arms now in circulation among underground resistance groups"
 tfv_raj.8.d6: "A nationalist militia, reportedly tied to an underground resistance movement, stormed an arms factory, looting weapons and setting production lines ablaze before British authorities could respond. While the facility has been secured, stolen firearms are likely to be used in future uprisings against colonial rule."
 tfv_raj.8.d7: "Communal tensions boiled over as rival factions, both claiming to fight for India's future, clashed near a weapons depot. What began as a dispute over recruitment turned into an all-out battle, resulting in an arms factory being ransacked and key infrastructure destroyed. British authorities arrived too late to prevent the damage, and many suspect that elements from both Hindu and Muslim nationalist movements were involved."
 tfv_raj.8.d8: "Radicals with known affiliations to an anti-colonial paramilitary group infiltrated an armament facility, overpowering security and setting fire to stockpiled ammunition. British forces quickly regained control, but the attackers vanished into the surrounding hills, leaving behind slogans condemning foreign rule."

 tfv_raj.9.d1: "A surge of unrest swept through an industrial district, culminating in rioters breaking into a civilian factory and causing widespread destruction. Tools and machinery were wrecked, while stores of construction materials mysteriously vanished. Officials suspect the stolen materials will fuel further unrest in the region."
 tfv_raj.9.d2: "Protesters took to the streets, setting fire to textile mills and looting finished goods before dispersing into the city. Many of the rioters were seen waving Congress Party banners, denouncing British rule, while others bore signs calling for a Hindu Rashtra."
 tfv_raj.9.d3: "A factory producing steel components for rail expansion was overrun, its inventory plundered, and work schedules indefinitely delayed. A faction of militant workers, reportedly tied to communist organizers, declared the destruction a necessary blow against imperial capitalism before disappearing into the slums."
 tfv_raj.9.d4: "Machinery was smashed, and workers fled as nationalist slogans echoed through the factory halls, halting all production indefinitely. British loyalist employees attempting to resist were beaten and driven out, further deepening divisions between Indian factions and colonial authorities."
 tfv_raj.9.d5: "Muslim League-affiliated activists led a march against British industrial interests but were met by armed Hindu nationalists. The two groups clashed in the factory district before both turned their ire against British-owned businesses, burning warehouses and looting supplies in an act of defiance."
 tfv_raj.9.d6: "Workers affiliated with a nationalist underground movement walked out of a civilian factory today, refusing to continue production under British rule. The protest quickly escalated into a riot, with government loyalists clashing against strikers. Before authorities could intervene, the factory was looted, and key machinery was destroyed."
 tfv_raj.9.d7: "A group linked to a radical independence faction sabotaged a textile mill, cutting power lines and smashing machinery before setting fire to raw materials. Investigations point to agitators embedded within local trade unions, working in secret to cripple British economic interests."
 tfv_raj.9.d8: "An anti-colonial syndicate calling for mass resistance against British industry orchestrated the looting of a steelworks facility. Construction materials and tools disappeared overnight, likely redirected to clandestine workshops producing makeshift weapons for future unrest."
 tfv_raj.9.d9: "Protesters took to the streets, setting fire to textile mills and looting finished goods before dispersing into the city. Many of the rioters were seen waving Congress Party banners, denouncing British rule, while others bore signs calling for a Hindu Rashtra."

 tfv_raj.10.d2: "Railway tracks leading into an industrial hub were uprooted and set ablaze, bringing supply convoys to a halt. The attackers, reportedly associated with the Azad Hind movement, left behind messages calling for an end to British economic exploitation."
 tfv_raj.10.d3: "A group of saboteurs infiltrated a power station, setting charges that crippled the regional electrical grid, causing rolling blackouts. The attackers scrawled nationalist slogans on the walls before vanishing into the night, leaving the city without power and paralyzed by fear."
 tfv_raj.10.d4: "Members of the Khaksar Movement, a militant Muslim group, took control of a bridge and dismantled key structural components before British troops arrived. Their goal was clear—to weaken colonial control and demonstrate their ability to disrupt governance at will."
 tfv_raj.10.d5: "A militant cell aligned with a separatist faction detonated explosives beneath a key railway bridge, severing supply lines and delaying transport across the region. Intelligence suggests this act was intended as a demonstration of strength against colonial authorities, signaling further escalation in the independence movement."
 tfv_raj.10.d6: "Saboteurs linked to an underground revolutionary network dismantled rail lines outside a major industrial hub, leaving behind messages condemning British rule and calling for full self-governance. Authorities believe they had outside support, likely from exiled nationalist leaders funding resistance efforts."
 tfv_raj.10.d7: "An airport was forced to close after thousands of mining picks were discovered scattered across the runway, an act of coordinated sabotage believed to be the work of anti-colonial extremists.

The attack has sparked panic, further destabilizing the region. The identity of the perpetrators remains unknown, but many suspect radical elements from within both Hindu and Muslim nationalist movements."
 tfv_raj.11.d2: "Protesters stormed government buildings, ransacking records and disrupting administration. Many waved flags of the Indian National Congress, while others displayed symbols of Sikh autonomy movements. The destruction has ground governance to a halt in the city, leaving officials scrambling to reassert control."
 tfv_raj.11.d3: "A violent general strike has paralyzed an entire district, halting production and commerce as workers demand autonomy. The Communist Party of India has been rumored to be behind the escalation, using the strike as a platform to call for socialist revolution."
 tfv_raj.11.d4: "A nationalist group set fire to British administrative offices, erasing critical records and paralyzing regional governance. The attackers, believed to be followers of Subhas Chandra Bose, left behind leaflets calling for mass rebellion before disappearing into the surrounding countryside."
 tfv_raj.11.d5: "A coordinated attack by a nationalist paramilitary group has left a major city paralyzed, as bombings and riots erupted across key districts. Government offices were stormed, banners of independence were raised, and British security forces were forced into brutal street battles to restore order."
 tfv_raj.11.d6: "An extremist wing of a nationalist political movement took to the streets, overwhelming law enforcement and setting fire to markets and administrative buildings. While British authorities eventually crushed the rebellion, anti-colonial propaganda is now circulating across the city, emboldening future resistance."
 tfv_raj.11.d7: "A pro-independence militia detonated explosives in a densely populated government center, triggering mass panic and civilian casualties. The attack has shocked the region, raising fears that more radicalized groups may be preparing for larger-scale uprisings."
 tfv_raj.11.d8: "Peasant uprisings have erupted in multiple districts, driven by resentment over high taxation and British land policies. The movement is led by grassroots organizers who have convinced local farmers to stop paying taxes and resist evictions. Reports indicate that some protest leaders have links to underground revolutionary cells."
 tfv_raj.12.t: "Assassination of a Local Leader!"
 tfv_raj.12.d1: "A district official was ambushed and assassinated while traveling through the countryside. The attack, suspected to be the work of radical Hindutva elements, has further destabilized the region and emboldened opposition movements."
 tfv_raj.12.d2: "A religious leader was gunned down in broad daylight, sparking riots and retaliatory violence in the city. The Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha both blame each other, turning the assassination into a catalyst for widespread unrest."
 tfv_raj.12.d3: "A British magistrate was found dead, executed by unknown assailants in what appears to be a targeted political killing. His body was left hanging in the streets as a warning. Authorities suspect the involvement of revolutionaries aligned with the Forward Bloc faction of Subhas Chandra Bose."
 tfv_raj.12.d4: "A rising nationalist figure was assassinated, though the identity of the perpetrators remains unknown—fueling conspiracy theories and growing public unrest. The Indian National Congress calls for calm, while underground militant groups vow revenge. The atmosphere is thick with paranoia, and the cycle of violence shows no sign of ending."
 tfv_raj.12.d5: "A pro-British local administrator was shot dead in a targeted assassination carried out by members of a nationalist faction. The killing has sent shockwaves through the government, as it signals the increasing boldness of anti-colonial militias operating in the region."
 tfv_raj.12.d6: "An official aligned with a separatist movement was gunned down in broad daylight, likely by rivals who see his movement as a betrayal of the independence struggle. The assassination has sparked violent street clashes between competing nationalist factions, each blaming the other for the unrest."
 tfv_raj.12.d7: "A magistrate known for his harsh crackdowns on nationalist activities was assassinated while traveling under heavy guard. The ambush was swift, precise, and executed with military discipline, suggesting that underground resistance groups have begun adopting more sophisticated insurgent tactics."
 food_stolen_tt: "5k of Food is lost from our storage"
 tfv_raj.13.t: "Mass Raids on Food Supplies!"
 tfv_raj.13.d1: "A nationalist group seeking to disrupt British control over agricultural resources raided a grain storage facility, seizing thousands of sacks of food to redistribute among their supporters. Officials fear this could embolden further attacks on supply chains."
 tfv_raj.13.d2: "Communal tensions exploded as religious extremists looted and torched food reserves belonging to rival sects. Entire villages now face starvation as factions target each other's supply lines in an escalating cycle of violence."
 tfv_raj.13.d3: "Pro-independence rebels ambushed a government food convoy, leaving supply trucks in flames and their drivers fleeing for their lives. The assault was coordinated, well-planned, and executed with precision, raising concerns about the growing organization of anti-British militant cells."
 tfv_raj.13.d4: "A convoy carrying grain intended for distribution in a majority-Muslim district was intercepted and looted by Hindu nationalist groups. The attackers, accusing the local Muslim population of harboring anti-British radicals, set fire to several remaining grain carts. Local officials warn that tensions are reaching a boiling point, and further retaliation is inevitable."
 tfv_raj.13.d5: "A large Hindu-majority village reported mass food thefts after an armed group of Muslim nationalists stormed granaries and storehouses, taking control of vital food stocks. Several Hindu farmers attempting to resist were beaten, and their homes burned. The Muslim League has issued a statement denying involvement, but reports suggest that regional militias are increasingly taking matters into their own hands."
 tfv_raj.13.d6: "A Sikh farming community was raided by a coalition of Hindu and Muslim extremist factions, each accusing the Sikhs of withholding food supplies from their respective communities. The attackers destroyed hundreds of bushels of wheat and set fire to barns before clashing with local Sikh defenders. The region is now on high alert, as fear spreads that further religious violence may erupt."
 tfv_raj.13.d7: "Religious extremists raided a livestock farm owned by a Sikh landholder, slaughtering cattle and setting fire to grain stores. Muslim and Hindu militias both blamed the Sikhs for profiting off the ongoing shortages, while Sikh leaders condemned the attack as an attempt to drive their people from the land. With trust between communities eroding, further acts of violence seem inevitable."
 tfv_raj.13.d8: "In defiance of British agricultural policies, thousands of farmers have refused to sell grain to government officials, demanding fair prices and an end to forced quotas. Many are believed to be influenced by nationalist movements, particularly those advocating self-reliance and agrarian reforms. Colonial authorities fear that if the boycott spreads, food shortages could become severe."
 tfv_raj.13.d9: "Villages across the region have begun non-cooperation movements, refusing to work on British-owned plantations and disrupting key agricultural supply chains. Protesters have removed British-appointed village officials and re-established local councils under nationalist leadership. If this defiance is not contained, rural governance could collapse entirely."
 tfv_raj.14.t: "Religious Tensions Spark Further Unrest!"
 tfv_raj.14.d1: "Fierce clashes have erupted between Hindu and Muslim nationalist factions, each blaming the other for betraying the independence struggle. Rival militias are forming in urban centers, and British officials fear that sectarian violence may soon overshadow anti-colonial resistance itself."
 tfv_raj.14.d2: "A well-known religious leader advocating for a separate homeland was assassinated by suspected members of a rival nationalist group, igniting widespread violence. Retaliatory attacks have already begun, and regional authorities are struggling to contain the growing hostilities."
 tfv_raj.14.d3: "Extremist elements within a nationalist faction led a march through a city, deliberately targeting religious minorities. The violence has forced thousands to flee their homes, further destabilizing an already tense political landscape."
 tfv_raj.14.d4: "Violence has erupted between Hindu and Muslim communities, with clashes spreading across multiple towns. The Muslim League and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh have both accused each other of instigating the unrest, while British authorities struggle to contain the situation."
 tfv_raj.14.d5: "Sikh temples were attacked, fueling resentment and calls for retribution. Extremist elements within both Hindu and Muslim factions see Sikh neutrality as an unacceptable stance, leading to increased tensions. Many Sikhs now speak openly of establishing an independent Khalistan."
 tfv_raj.14.d6: "Reports indicate Muslim-majority villages have been targeted by Hindu nationalist groups, igniting sectarian violence. The All-India Muslim League has condemned the attacks, while Hindu Mahasabha leaders blame British divide-and-rule policies for the growing hostility."
 tfv_raj.14.d7: "A Hindu festival procession turned into a riot, leading to mass arrests and inflaming regional tensions. Muslim activists claim the event was intentionally provocative, while Hindu nationalists argue it was their right to celebrate without interference. The violence has shattered any pretense of unity in the region."
 tfv_raj.14.d8: "Religious leaders in rural areas have taken up the cause of land redistribution, demanding the expulsion of British landlords and the return of farmland to Indian cultivators. Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh factions have all staked claims to vast tracts of land, further fueling sectarian tensions. British officials warn that these disputes could lead to armed conflict."
 tfv_raj.14.d9: "Inspired by nationalist calls for self-reliance, rural communities have begun hoarding food, cutting off supply routes to British-controlled towns. Merchants who continue selling to colonial authorities face intimidation and threats from locals. If left unchecked, this movement could spiral into a full-blown economic insurgency."
 tfv_raj.15.t: "Calls for Nonviolent Resistance Grow"
 tfv_raj.15.d1: "Mahatma Gandhi’s calls for peaceful non-cooperation continue to gain traction among the Indian population, particularly in urban centers. Many activists advocate boycotts, protests, and tax resistance instead of armed struggle. While this movement weakens direct insurrectionist activities, it also undermines recruitment for more militant nationalist factions."
 tfv_raj.15.d2: "A massive nonviolent demonstration in a major city has brought the local administration to a standstill. Tens of thousands of protesters filled the streets, refusing to disperse until their demands for greater self-governance are addressed. British officials have refrained from using force, fearing it could spark further unrest."
 tfv_raj.15.d3: "Growing support for pacifist nationalism has caused friction within the independence movement. While many call for a peaceful transition to self-rule, hardline factions argue that armed resistance is the only path forward. Reports suggest that some militant groups are beginning to view nonviolent activists as obstacles rather than allies."
 tfv_raj.15.d4: "British officials report a decline in violent nationalist activity in regions where the pacifist movement has gained traction. However, this has also led to mass work stoppages, tax boycotts, and a general slowdown in economic productivity, further straining governance."
 tfv_raj.15.d5: "Religious leaders from multiple faiths have joined calls for nonviolent resistance, framing colonial rule as a moral issue rather than a political one. This shift has drawn support from rural populations, many of whom were previously reluctant to engage in the independence movement."
 tfv_raj.15.d6: "Jainist Peace Activists have held large religious gatherings across major cities that garnered support from moderate factions within both the Muslim and Hindu communities - encouraging all Indians to put aside their differences and find common ground in the hopes of mutual prosperity and peace both inside and outside of the Raj's borders."
 tfv_raj.16.t: "Trains Derailed by Insurgent Action!"
 tfv_raj.16.d1: "A heavily loaded troop transport train was derailed in a remote district, its rails ripped apart by explosives planted overnight. Witnesses report armed men, likely linked to nationalist militias, attacking survivors before vanishing into the jungles. British authorities are struggling to secure rail routes, as these coordinated attacks grow more frequent."
 tfv_raj.16.d2: "Saboteurs blew up a bridge along a critical railway corridor, sending a fully loaded freight train plunging into the river below. The attackers, suspected members of an underground resistance movement, left behind nationalist slogans scrawled along the remaining rail lines. Recovery efforts are underway, but the disruption will take weeks to repair."
 tfv_raj.16.d3: "Armed insurgents ambushed a British armored train carrying supplies and munitions, forcing it to stop under heavy gunfire before setting charges along the tracks. As the train exploded into flames, the attackers disappeared into the night. British forces are now increasing patrols along vulnerable sections of the railway network."
 tfv_raj.16.d4: "A section of railway in Bengal was ripped apart by hidden mines, sending a government mail train crashing into the jungle. Authorities believe this attack was planned by radicals hoping to disrupt colonial administration. The wreckage has paralyzed rail movement in the region, and local officials fear further attacks."
 tfv_raj.16.d5: "A railway station in Punjab came under a surprise assault by nationalist paramilitaries, who stormed the area, seized weapons from railway guards, and set fire to supply depots and locomotives. British reinforcements arrived too late, finding only smoldering wreckage and rail lines twisted beyond use."
 tfv_raj.16.d6: "A series of coordinated railway bombings across key supply lines have left entire districts without regular rail transport. Reports indicate the attacks were carried out by a highly organized underground resistance movement, aiming to cripple British supply efforts and force local authorities into a defensive posture."
 tfv_raj.16.d7: "Protests have intensified as railway unions refuse to transport British military personnel or colonial officials, bringing entire sections of the railway industry to a standstill. While the strike has not yet spread nationwide, its impact is being felt across key provinces, putting the British administration in a difficult position."
 tfv_raj.16.d8: "Groups of demonstrators have flooded train stations across the Raj, preventing British troops and officials from boarding trains. These protests, though nonviolent, have disrupted entire rail schedules, stranding government personnel in key cities. Police intervention has only fueled further unrest."
 tfv_raj.16.d9: "Activists and students aligned with nationalist movements have been removing railway spikes and damaging signals, forcing British rail operators to halt services out of fear of accidents. While the sabotage is not overtly destructive, the disruption has thrown military and commercial supply lines into disarray."
 tfv_raj.21.t:0 "The Bengal Famine"
 tfv_raj.21.desc:0 "Bengal has suffered famines before, but this time events have conspired to make things so much worse than usual. The staggeringly incompetent colonial administration has shown itself utterly unable - or perhaps even unwilling - to adequately react to a cyclone wiping out much of the rice harvest in Bengal. With refugees pouring in from the war stricken regions of the country, demand for food is growing every day while supply is falling short. \n\nFood prices have risen dramatically, leading to people staying away from work that no longer pays enough to feed their families. Recruitment numbers for the army have also dropped considerably as more and more people refuse to leave their homes to fight for a government that does nothing to help them."
 tfv_raj.21.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 tfv_raj_focus_paratrooper_tt:0 "Battaglione Azad Hindoustan paratroopers will be deployed in Italy."
 tfv_raj.201.t:0 "The Battaglione Azad Hindoustan"
 tfv_raj.201.desc:0 "Recruited from Prisoners of War, the soldiers of the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan have sworn to give their life in pursuit of Indian freedom. Trained in sabotage and infiltration, these elite soldiers are also capable of being dropped by parachute to wreak havoc behind enemy lines."
 tfv_raj.201.a:0 "Strike from the skies, brothers!"
 tfv_raj.210.t:0 "Sabotage?"
 tfv_raj.210.desc:0 "The local workers had just broken for lunch when a violent explosion rocked one of our factories. Significant damage was done to the building itself, and several workers were injured by flying glass. Thankfully, the machine tools seem to have remained mostly intact. Police and army units have constructed a perimeter while investigators pick through the rubble in a search for clues to the cause of the explosion.\n\nRumors abound that it was the work of a resitance cell from the Quit India movement, turning their protest to violence in their struggle for freedom."
 tfv_raj.210.a:0 "Disturbing."
 tfv_raj.211.t:0 "Sabotage!"
 tfv_raj.211.desc:0 "Just weeks after the first explosion, a second factory was suddenly destroyed, again just after the workers had left the main building for lunch. There can be little doubt that this is the work of an organized resistance group conducting a well-planned campaign of sabotage and terrorism. The brazen attacks in broad daylight show that the attackers appear to be very sure of themselves. "
 tfv_raj.211.a:0 "Will no one stop them?"
 tfv_raj.212.t:0 "The Enemy Within"
 tfv_raj.212.desc:0 "A third explosion has devastated a factory in on of our states. This time, it appears the attacks got the timing wrong, as the bomb exploded halfway through the shift. Dozens of workers were killed and dozens more are still missing. Investigators are pursuing several leads, and a number of houses have already been searched. The results are deeply disturbing, ranging from Quit India propaganda to tools that could be used to create crude explosives. \n\nNone of those arrested seem to be the ringleaders, however, and they have so far refused to talk."
 tfv_raj.212.a:0 "This is getting out of hand."
 tfv_raj_quit_india_unrest_tt:0 "The movement's supporters are expected to demand change."
