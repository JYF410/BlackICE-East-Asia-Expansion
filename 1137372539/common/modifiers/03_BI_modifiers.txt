# All our BICE modifiers here
# Important: If you want these modifiers to be displayed in the diplomacy tab, next to diplomatic actions
# go to ideas/zzz_token_base, and add a token inside there (see close_cooperation for reference in that file)
# then, go to scripted_triggers/diplomacy_scripte_triggers and add your new modifier inside display_relation_modifiers

# GFX for these is GFX_relation_<modifier>
