 KOR_PRC_food_support_desc:5 "During the Liberation War in Northeast China, the Korean government and people provided significant support to the Northeast Democratic United Army, particularly in terms of supplies. Korea not only provided large quantities of weapons, ammunition, uniforms, and medicine free of charge but also supplied grain and other daily necessities through trade channels. These aids played a crucial role in alleviating supply shortages and maintaining the combat effectiveness of frontline troops. This support reflects the deep friendship and solidarity between the two peoples."
